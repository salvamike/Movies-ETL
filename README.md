# Movies-ETL

##Project Overview

Raw data exists in multiple places and forms. In order to perform any kind of data analysis, this data needs to be cleaned and structured. Data pipeline process ETL – Extract, Transform, and Load is a core concept in data engineering, ensuring that data is consistent, maintains its integrity, and nontheless strives for automatization of data wrangling. Without a consistent and robust data structure, it’s nearly impossible to perform any meaningful analysis.

##Purpose

The Amazing Prime, a video streaming company, decided to sponsor a hackathon, where participants trying to predict which low budget movies being released will become popular. Participants of a hackathon need a clean data in order to perform analyses for their algorithms. In order to provide organized and clean dataset, this project focuses on ETL* or Extract, Transform and Load process and includes the following:

Extracting data from two different sources.
web scrape of Wikipedia website for all movies released since 1990
data from Kaggle website for rating data.
Transforming data using Jupyter Notebook, Python, Pandas and Python RegEx module.
Loading data using PostgreSQL and pgAdmin to host final cleaned data set.
